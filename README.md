Olympics is a programming exercise. It's purpose is to demonstrate clean,
boring code in a semi-realistic setting.

In `scripts/`, there are two scripts:

* `benchmark_import_techniques.rb` - benchmarks the different ways data can
be imported into a Rails application backed by postgres.

* `load_data.rb` - generates data necessary to play with the application
